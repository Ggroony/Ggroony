- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ggroony, a Software Development Student at Champlain College
- 👀 I’m interested in making unique projects that expand my knowledge and that are useful to me on a daily basis.
- 🌱 I've had course work in OOP via C++ and Python, and experience with HTML/CSS. Recently I've also had the oppportunity to dive into SQL & Relational design, which along with OOP has been my favorite development work thus far.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new video game ideas, OOP design projects, webcrawlers, and working with API's  (So I can learn about all of the above) 
- 📫 How to reach me: bgroonwald@gmail.com
