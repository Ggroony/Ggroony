- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ggroony, a Software Development Student at Champlain College
- 👀 I’m interested in making unique projects that expand my knowledge and that are useful to me on a daily basis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C++, HTML & CSS. However, I'd like to learn more about object oriented programing, and to 
-    develop my own game. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new video game ideas, webcrawlers, and working with API's  (So I can learn about all of the above) 
- 📫 How to reach me: bgroonwald@gmail.com
